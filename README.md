# Gatsby Start Shopify App

Serverless Shopify App via Netlify Functions & GatsbyJS

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gil--/gatsby-starter-shopify-app)

**Demo** - [https://gatsby-starter-shopify-app.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-shopify-app.netlify.com/)

## Features
- ‚úÖ Serverless via Netlify Functions
- ‚úÖ GatsbyJS Client
- ‚úÖ Ability to Install App
- ‚úÖ [Shopify Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) for UI
- ‚úÖ [Custom Link Component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/app-provider#navigation) to work with Gatsby Link (avoid page refresh and use React Router)
- ‚úÖ Prevent force redirect to Shopify admin iframe if in develop mode `<AppProvider forceRedirect={false}>`

## Bugs
- üêû Rework serverless re-auth logic to use async/await instead of redirection. Should just return a JSON response instead of all the redirections for re-auth since no callback is needed.
